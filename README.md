# Unity Car Physics Simulator

Welcome to the Unity Car Physics Simulator, a project designed to simulate realistic car physics in a 3D environment, incorporating advanced features such as suspension dynamics and the Ackermann steering angle for precise turning radius control.

## Overview

This Unity project aims to provide an immersive and realistic simulation of car physics within a 3D environment. The key features include:

### Realistic Suspension Dynamics
- The project incorporates a sophisticated suspension system that mimics the behavior of a real car's suspension. This includes handling various terrains, bumps, and uneven surfaces.

### Ackermann Steering Angle
- The Ackermann steering geometry is implemented to ensure accurate turning radius and realistic handling during turns. This geometry calculates the appropriate steering angle for each wheel based on the car's wheelbase and track width.

### Responsive Controls
- The project offers responsive controls that allow users to experience the intricacies of car handling. The input system is designed to capture user commands and translate them into realistic movements within the simulated environment.

### Detailed Physics Simulation
- The physics engine is carefully tuned to replicate the behavior of a real car, including factors such as weight distribution, center of mass, and tire friction. This attention to detail enhances the overall realism of the simulation.
